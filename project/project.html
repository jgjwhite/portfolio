                                  The Port is a fish and chips restaurant located on Manitoulin Island
                                  in Northern Ontario. A responsive, mobile first website was designed and
                                  developed for their restaurant, that included their menu, hours and contact
                                  information, as well as a live updating facebook news feed. I put together the
                                  website mockups, as well as site illustrations, and contributed to the site

                                  The Bloomberg Per Security Data License enables financial professionals
                                  to request customizable data fields on a user-specified set of securities.
                                  This flexibility is highly valuable, and therefore widely used; however
                                  keeping track of the pricing of these requests firm-wide can be confusing,
                                  and often leads to cost spirals. The Big Bloom Cost Rationalization tool
                                  plays the role of granting users of the Per Security Data License greater
                                  insight into their costs and usage detail, and has the capability of
                                  highlighting large opportunities for savings.

                                I worked with the team at Market Data Company to build the interface for their
                                Beta release of the Big Bloom tool, which would later be marketed to buy-side
                                financial firms. Applying User Experience deliverables and UI patterns, I
                                developed a set of mockups for feedback and iteration, which ultimately informed
                                the final interface design.

                                  interior design brands as well as independent and boutique designer goods at
                                  wholesale prices. The Tressle Access initiative invited interior designers to
                                  purchase an exclusive annual membership in exchange for premium pricing and
                                  unlimited access. I designed and built the landing page that was later circulated
                                  to more than 5000 recipients as part of an e-mail marketing campaign.

                        in Northern Ontario. A responsive, mobile first website was designed and
                        developed for their restaurant, that included their menu, hours and contact
                        information, as well as a live updating facebook news feed. I put together the
                        website mockups, as well as site illustrations, and contributed to the site

                        The Bloomberg Per Security Data License enables financial professionals
                        to request customizable data fields on a user-specified set of securities.
                        This flexibility is highly valuable, and therefore widely used; however
                        keeping track of the pricing of these requests firm-wide can be confusing,
                        and often leads to cost spirals. The Big Bloom Cost Rationalization tool
                        plays the role of granting users of the Per Security Data License greater
                        insight into their costs and usage detail, and has the capability of
                        highlighting large opportunities for savings.

                    <p>
                      I worked with the team at Market Data Company to build the interface for their
                      Beta release of the Big Bloom tool, which would later be marketed to buy-side
                      financial firms. Applying User Experience deliverables and UI patterns, I
                      developed a set of mockups for feedback and iteration, which ultimately informed
                      the final interface design.

                        Tressle.com is an online marketplace specializing in home design, selling both major
                        interior design brands as well as independent and boutique designer goods at
                        wholesale prices. The Tressle Access initiative invited interior designers to
                        purchase an exclusive annual membership in exchange for premium pricing and
                        unlimited access. I designed and built the landing page that was later circulated
                        to more than 5000 recipients as part of an e-mail marketing campaign.

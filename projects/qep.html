      </div>

      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>
          As part of a user centered design course, a group of staff members from the Queen Elizabeth
          Park Community Centre visited our class and briefed us on their problem. The challenge
          put forward had to do with redesigning their online scheduling system to make it more
          intuitive and suitable for their audience.
        </p>

        <p>
          We worked in teams throughout the semester to tackle this problem. Our roles were fluid
          and each of us contributed to the different process steps.

      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>
          The staff leaders from Queen Elizabeth Park Centre reported that members expressed
          frustration with the online studio schedule. The website is complicated and
          difficult to use, so members resorted to dropping in. Since studios would
          often fill up, this lead to members having to turn around and head back home.

        <p>
          <h6>Intuitive use:</h6> our audience should be able to easily navigate through the interface.

          <h6>Enhance overall studio experience:</h6> the entire studio experience (before, during and after) should be taken into account during the design process.

    <!-- Site Visit -->

          <h3>Site Vist &amp; Stakeholder Interviews</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>
          We visited QEP and noticed that facility navigation was a challenge: there were no obvious site maps
          near the entrance. We found out that members rely on handwritten calendars posted on the studio
          doors, and when drop-in studios filled up during a given time, any newcomers would be turned away.

        </p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <!-- Journey Mapping -->

          <h3>Journey Map</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>
          Some of the observations explored included The online schedule was difficult to find on the QEP
          home page, and it was overly complex. Visitors would be turned away from studios if it was full at
          the time, having to either choose a different studio or return at another time. There was also a
          lack of high visibility on-site facility navigation. Using these pain points, we saw opportunities
          to explore during our design phase.

        </p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <!-- User Scenarios -->
    <div class="row project-text">
      <div class="small-12 medium-4 columns">
          <h3>User Scenarios</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>
          A scenario analysis pointed to a need to incorporate program registration (distinct from drop-in
          studios). Programs are structured courses offered to QEP members for learning different creative
          practices. At this stage, we began to tinker with the idea of an on-site kiosk; as a means to
          increase the visibility of both the map and schedule.

        </p>
      </div>
    </div>


    <!-- Prototyping -->
    <div class="row project-text">

          <h3>Testable Prototypes</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>
          Two prototypes were tested: a kiosk design, which I was involved with (and depicted above),
          as well as a separate browser-only design. The browser design provided a comparison for
          participants to give feedback on.

          <h3>User Testing</h3>
      </div>

      <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
        <p>
          I drafted our testing brief, scenario and script for the on-site user test. We noted that
          there was an interest in the kiosk companion. Program registration had positive feedback,
          but the information architecture needed technical adjustments. For example, it was recommended
          that we prioritize the need for a safety certification before people could view or book certain
          studios. Participants also wanted an opt-out button when asked for personal information, where possible.

              <h3>View Studio Availability</h3>

              <p class="twenty-four">
                Users could now walk up to a kiosk, or visit the website, and immediately see the studio
                availability because we chose to move the schedule to the home screen. The visual design
                was based on familiarity, which was considered an important factor for improving the ease
                of use. Accessibility considerations were taking into account; colour choices were tested
                using a WCAG contrast checker, and type size was increased across the interface.

                 An opt-out toggle was added to any personal or financial information requests (beyond e-mail
                 address). The user could now elect to pay at the front desk in the revised prototype, and
                 the labelling system was adjusted based on our testing. For example; “classes” was changed
                 to “programs,” with specific “courses” to register with.

                <p class="twenty-four">
                  The added tab bar enabled a link to the QEP map to be available on every screen.
                  Visitors could tap the icon at the kiosk, and view a map of QEP from any screen within
                  the interface. We also added a map search feature, where visitors could quickly focus
                  the map on one of the creative studios.

        <div class="small-12 medium-8 columns">
          <p>
            Presenting our prototype to QEP staff let us re-examine our design objectives and weigh
            them against staff feedback.<br /><br />

            <h6>Ease of Use.</h6>
            Visiting staff members made note that the kiosk interface was intuitive, and that the kiosk
            would be a popular addition to the QEP foyer.<br /><br />

            <h6>Enhance Overall Studio Experience.</h6>
            Features like adding the facility map, and making a kiosk companion took into account
            the overall studio experience.<br /><br />

            <h6>Inclusive Design.</h6>
            Our visual design tried to consider accessibility. However, in reflection it felt like
            we only addressed surface level concerns. I would have liked to have done more research
            into different types of impairments, and how our design could be adjusted to be more
            inclusive.

      <h4>Bio</h4>
      <p>
        I'm an interactive designer seeking to work at the intersection of technology, data and design.
        I enjoy the challenge of creating products that people will use. Beginning with researching the
        problem and then exploring solutions through an iterative process, I believe that what makes a
        solution good is that it has a measurable effect on the end user. I’m particularly interested in
        design's role in easing the adoption of technology. In my spare time, I tinker with illustration
        and coding. I’ve found that exploring different design mediums has helped to strengthen my creative process.
        <br /><br />
        Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio, and feel free to reach out to me for
        collaboration or work opportunities.
